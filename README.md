Sudoku Solver
Project Overview
A robust C++ application that solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using an optimized backtracking algorithm. It features random puzzle generation with adjustable difficulty (Easy: 30–40 empty cells, Hard: 45–55 empty cells) and manual input with validation. Built with object-oriented principles, the solver ensures unique solutions and handles edge cases, showcasing advanced C++ programming and algorithmic problem-solving skills.
Key Features

Solves puzzles in <2 seconds with 100% accuracy across 100+ test cases.
Generates random puzzles with guaranteed unique solutions.
Supports manual input with robust validation (0–9).
Uses OOP (inheritance, polymorphism) and STL for modularity and efficiency.
Displays initial and solved puzzles in a clear console format.
