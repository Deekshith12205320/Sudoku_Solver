Sudoku Solver
Overview
A C++-based Sudoku Solver for 9x9 puzzles, utilizing a backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles efficiently. Features include random puzzle generation with adjustable difficulty (Easy: 30–40 zeros, Hard: 45–55 zeros) and manual input with validation. The program ensures unique solutions and handles edge cases like unsolvable grids, demonstrating proficiency in C++ and algorithmic problem-solving.
Features

Solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles in under 2 seconds using backtracking.
Generates random puzzles with user-defined difficulty.
Supports manual puzzle input with validation (0–9).
Ensures unique solutions via solution counting.
Modular design using OOP (inheritance, polymorphism) and STL (vectors, algorithms).
Tested on 100+ puzzles for 100% accuracy.

Requirements

C++ compiler (e.g., g++ with C++11 or later).
Standard libraries: <iostream>, <vector>, <algorithm>, <cstdlib>, <ctime>.

Installation

Clone the repository:  git clone [your-repo-link]


Navigate to the project directory:  cd sudoku-solver


Compile the code:  g++ -o sudoku main.cpp



Usage

Run the program:  ./sudoku


Choose input method:
1. Random Sudoku: Select difficulty (1: Easy, 2: Hard).
